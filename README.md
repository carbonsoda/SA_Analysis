# SA Analysis

A series of functions to clean and prepare data for analysis for
the dyscord lab's SA study.

## To do
1. Make the timestamps of the gaze_positions match up with the
  `.log` file
   - This will help account for disruptions
2. For the exports folder, use the most recently updated one instead
  of highest number
3. Make the file searching interactive in command prompt
