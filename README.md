### To Do
1. Finish up the matching of the images in the log to the output. 
   1. However... there's a mismatch in numbers? The log shoes 56 images total, whereas the surfaces + gaze positions on the surface shows 58
2. Make the file searching interactive in command prompt
3. Need to ask/meet to understand what more features are needed, ie how to sort it and prep for planned analysis
